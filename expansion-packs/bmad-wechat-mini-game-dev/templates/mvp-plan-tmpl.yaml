# MVP Plan for {{GAME_NAME}} - A WeChat Mini Game

## 1. MVP Vision
- **What is the single, most important problem we are solving or need we are fulfilling with this MVP?**
- *Example: "To provide a quick, engaging, and social puzzle experience that users can enjoy in short bursts and share with their WeChat friends."*

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop
- **Describe the essential, repeatable cycle of actions the player will perform.**
- *Example: 1. Start a new puzzle -> 2. Drag and drop pieces -> 3. Complete the puzzle -> 4. Receive a score -> 5. Share score with friends -> (Repeat)*

## 3. Key MVP Features (The "Must-Haves")
- This is a prioritized list of features that are absolutely essential for the first version.

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MVP-001 | Player Authentication | Log in using WeChat account (`wx.login`). | Must-Have |
| MVP-002 | Main Menu | A simple screen with a "Start Game" button. | Must-Have |
| MVP-003 | Core Game Scene | The main screen where the gameplay happens. | Must-Have |
| MVP-004 | Basic Game Mechanics | The fundamental rules and interactions of the game. | Must-Have |
| MVP-005 | Win/Loss Condition | Clear criteria for winning or losing a game session. | Must-Have |
| MVP-006 | End-of-Game Screen | Displays the player's score or result. | Must-Have |

| MVP-008 | Simple Data Persistence | Save the player's high score locally on the device (`wx.setStorage`). | Must-Have |
| MVP-009 | Share Functionality | A button to share the game or score to a WeChat chat. | Must-Have |

## 4. Features "Out of Scope" for MVP (The "Won't-Haves" for now)
- This list is just as important as the "in-scope" list. It prevents scope creep.

| Feature Name | Reason for Exclusion | Potential Future Release |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| User Profile Page | Not essential for the core loop. | V2 |
| In-Game Store | Monetization can be added after validating the core game. | V2 |
| Daily Challenges | Adds complexity; can be a future engagement feature. | V3 |
| Friend Leaderboards | Requires backend development; can be added post-MVP. | V2 |
| Multiple Levels/Modes | Focus on perfecting one mode first. | V2 |
| Push Notifications | Not critical for initial launch. | V3 |
| Animated Tutorials | A simple instruction image or text will suffice for MVP. | V2 |

## 5. MVP Success Metrics
- **How will we know if the MVP is a success?**
- We need clear, measurable goals.

| Metric | Success Target |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1 Retention Rate** | > 20% |
| **Average Session Length** | > 3 minutes |
| **Number of Shares per User** | > 0.1 |
| **Total Installs** | > 1,000 in the first week |
| **Crash-Free Rate** | > 99% |

## 6. Technical Stack for MVP
- **Frontend:** WeChat Mini Game Framework (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Backend:** None required for MVP (or specify if needed, e.g., for `wx.login` session exchange).
- **Art/Audio:** Placeholder or simplified assets are acceptable.
- **WeChat APIs:** `wx.login`, `wx.getSystemInfo`, `wx.createCanvas`, `wx.createInnerAudioContext`, `wx.setStorage`, `wx.getStorage`, `wx.shareAppMessage`.
