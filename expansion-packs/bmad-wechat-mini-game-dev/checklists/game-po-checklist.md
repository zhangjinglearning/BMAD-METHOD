# Game Product Owner (PO) Master Validation Checklist (WeChat Mini Game)

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Game Product Owner to validate game project plans before WeChat Mini Game development execution. It adapts based on project type (new game vs existing game enhancement) and includes platform considerations.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - GAME PO MASTER CHECKLIST

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the game project type by checking:

1. Is this a NEW GAME project (greenfield)?
   - Look for: New WeChat Mini Game project initialization, no existing game code
   - Check for: game-design-doc.md, architecture.md, new game setup

2. Is this an EXISTING GAME enhancement (brownfield)?
   - Look for: References to existing WeChat Mini Game project, enhancement language
   - Check for: existing project.config.json file
   - Existing scenes, scripts, and resources

3. What platforms are targeted?
   - Mobile (iOS/Android)
   - Desktop (Windows/Mac)

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Based on project type, ensure you have access to:

For NEW GAME projects:

- game-design-doc.md - The Game Design Document
- architecture.md - The technical architecture
- platform-requirements.md - Platform specifications
- All epic and story definitions

For EXISTING GAME enhancements:

- enhancement-doc.md - The enhancement requirements
- existing WeChat Mini Game project access (CRITICAL)
- Current performance metrics
- Player feedback and analytics data
- Existing save game compatibility requirements

SKIP INSTRUCTIONS:

- Skip sections marked [[EXISTING GAME ONLY]] for new games
- Skip sections marked [[NEW GAME ONLY]] for existing games
- Skip sections marked [[MOBILE ONLY]] for desktop-only games
- Note all skipped sections in your final report

VALIDATION APPROACH:

1. Performance Focus - Every decision must support 60+ FPS target
2. Player Experience - Fun and engagement drive all choices
3. Platform Reality - Constraints guide implementation
4. Technical Feasibility - WeChat Mini Game capabilities define boundaries

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask if they want to work through:

- Section by section (interactive) - Review each, get confirmation
- All at once (comprehensive) - Complete analysis, present report]]
