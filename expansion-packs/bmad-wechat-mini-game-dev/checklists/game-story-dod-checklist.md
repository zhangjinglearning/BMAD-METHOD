# Game Development Story Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist (WeChat Mini Game)

## Instructions for Developer Agent

Before marking a story as 'Ready for Review', please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - WECHAT MINI GAME STORY DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for GAME DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their WeChat Mini Game implementation work before marking a story complete.

IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment following TDD principles. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. Performance targets (60+ FPS) are non-negotiable.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Verify tests were written FIRST (TDD compliance)
2. Go through each section systematically
3. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
4. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
5. Report performance metrics (FPS, draw calls, memory)
6. Flag any technical debt or optimization needs

The goal is performant, tested, quality delivery.]]
